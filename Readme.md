## Configuration
Before running the application, you need to configure your Reddit API credentials.

1. Open App.config (or appsettings.json if you are using .NET Core) and set the following values:

  ```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
  <configuration>
    <appSettings>
        <add key="appId" value="YOUR_REDDIT_APP_ID" />
        <add key="appSecret" value="YOUR_REDDIT_APP_SECRET" />
